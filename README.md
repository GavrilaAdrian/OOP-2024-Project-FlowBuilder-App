# OOP-2024-Project-FlowBuilder-App
A dynamic C++ application showcasing key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The FlowBuilder app enables users to construct customized linear flows effortlessly. With various step types, from text and number inputs to complex calculations and file operations, users can seamlessly design and execute processes. 
Problems of the application:
-some eerors dont get counted as they should in analytics
-i cannot use other steps in output step
-i didnt add:
How many times the flow has been started because it can be started only once - i added starting time instead for that
How many times the flow has been completed because it can be completed only once - i added ending time instead for that
Number of error screens displayed for each step - i added total numbers of errors for that
Average number of errors per flow completed
